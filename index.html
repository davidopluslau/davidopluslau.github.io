<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h3>

<p>My name is David Lau. I'm a software engineer at Refresh Inc., with a UC Berkeley degree in psychology, feet that prefer bicycle pedals to pavement, and a predilection for life satisfaction.</p>

        <h4>How I Got Here</h4>
        <p>At post-Judo practice dinner one night, another Judoka brought up a discovery of hers: a <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">blog from a dating website</a>. It had all sorts of insights: <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/"> women think men look atrocious but message them anyway. </a></a>If you want to determine your compatibility with someone, <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/">don't ask about God and sex, ask about horror films and traveling,</a> etc etc. I figured, this was all pretty cool, maybe I'll give an introductory course a shot. That initial interest in what I later discovered to be data science turned into one class... and then two... and then twelve. Along the way, I also discovered that I enjoyed just plain old software engineering. Building tools was fun. I did it first for <a href="http://www.vidcaster.com/">VidCaster</a>, building them an internal analytics display, as well as real-time metrics for their customers. The following year, I joined onto <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>'s digital coupon team, where I built a tool to add and remove coupons from the popular deals page. In 2014, I began work with <a href="http://www.refresh.io/">Refresh Inc.</a>, joining an incredible team to build the back-end for a mobile app that builds digital dossiers on the people you meet. There may be a day that I don't enjoy coding anymore. But until then, I'll follow my heart.</p>
            
        <h5>Stuff I Can Do</h5>
        <p>My native language is Python, and I live and breathe it. That said, much of my professional and serious academic work was done in Java, so I'm also fully fluent in that. I've used a Windows for personal computing my whole life, used a MacBook for a summer internship, and did all my academic work and most of my professional work in a Unix environment, so I have at least basic competency in all of them. In particular, I can out-grep almost all of my peers. I used to be a Vim snob; now I'm a Vim enthusiast (<a href="http://bytefluent.com/vivify/index.php?remote=raw.github.com%2Fdavidopluslau%2FLauVim%2Fmaster%2FLauIdleX.vim">my hand-crafted color scheme</a>, six hours of work and counting) who admits that Emacs has a lot of excellent strengths but still won't touch it. I've worked in the Django and Spring MVCs. And, I have a basic understanding of various front-end technologies like Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Though I'm no specialist in them, this page didn't (completely) build itself.<br><br></p>
        <p>I've got some other stuff I can do, but it's on my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59596352/Resume%20-%20David%20Lau.pdf">resume</a>. My email is davidopluslau@berkeley.edu (my blood type is O-positive). Feel free to ask more about my other skills, especially if you're the hiring sort :)</p>
        
        <h6>Stuff I Like to Do</h6>
            <p>Believe it or not, this section basically includes everything from the last section. Yes, I really do enjoy coding.<br><br></p>
            <p>But if you want me to prove I'm more than just a code-vomiting machine, bicycling's a good start. The day before I wrote this, a friend and I bicycled 26 miles through San Francisco on a whim. I bicycle basically everywhere. I also do Judo (brown belt, four years), and when that's not available, Brazilian Jiujitsu (white belt). My specialty is choking techniques. I also lift weights, with my proudest achievement being my 3x5 260 lb squat, well below parallel. I can fill a kitchen with smoke in a three minute span to make the tastiest spicy chicken you've ever had, or I can spend twelve hours cooking beef so tender it'll melt on contact with your fork. I'll drink basically any beer, but a dark lager, porter, or stout is almost guaranteed to put a smile on my face.</p>
            
        <h7>Contacting me</h7>
            <p>I generally respond to emails in under an hour, so if you'd like to contact me, you can reach me through davidopluslau@refresh.io</p>
