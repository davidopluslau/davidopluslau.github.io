<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h3>

<p>I'm David Lau. I'm a software engineer at Refresh Inc. and the bartender at the informal bar The Clever Eggplant, with a degree in psychology from UC Berkeley.</p>

        <h4>How I Got Here</h4>
        <p>At post-Judo practice dinner one night, another Judoka brought up a discovery of hers: a <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">blog from a dating website</a>. It had all sorts of insights: <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/"> women think men look atrocious but message them anyway. </a></a>If you want to determine your compatibility with someone, <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/">don't ask about God and sex, ask about horror films and traveling,</a> etc etc. I figured, this was all pretty cool, maybe I'll give an introductory course a shot. That initial interest in what I later discovered to be data science turned into one class... and then two... and then twelve. Along the way, I also discovered that I enjoyed just plain old software engineering. Building software was fun. I did it first in 2012 for <a href="http://www.vidcaster.com/">VidCaster</a>, building them an internal analytics display, as well as real-time metrics for their customers. The following year, I joined onto <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>'s digital coupon team, where I built a tool to add and remove coupons from the popular deals page. In 2014, I began work with <a href="https://refresh.io/about">Refresh Inc.</a>, joining an incredible team to build the back-end for a mobile app that builds digital dossiers on the people you meet, and I've never looked back.</p>
            
        <h5>Stuff I Can Do</h5>
        <p>The bulk of professional and academic work has been done in Java, and it is my primary language. My first language was Python, and I absolutely love the concise-but-readable style it affords. I've used a Windows for personal computing my whole life, used Macbooks for most of my professional work, and did all my academic work in a Unix environment, so I'm comfortable in all of them. I can write a dirty but effective bash script. I used to be a Vim snob; now I'm a Vim enthusiast (<a href="http://bytefluent.com/vivify/index.php?remote=raw.github.com%2Fdavidopluslau%2FLauVim%2Fmaster%2FLauIdleX.vim">my hand-crafted color scheme</a>, six hours of work and counting) who admits that Emacs has a lot of excellent strengths but still won't touch it. I've worked in the Django and Spring MVCs. And, I have a basic understanding of various front-end technologies like Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Though I'm no specialist in them, I built both this page as well as <a href="www.theclevereggplant.com" target="_blank">my bar's</a> page.<br><br></p>
        <p>I've got some other stuff I can do, but it's on my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59596352/Resume%20-%20David%20Lau.pdf">resume</a>. My email is davidopluslau@gmail.com (my blood type is O-positive). Feel free to ask more about my other skills, especially if you're the hiring sort :)</p>
        
        <h6>Stuff I Like to Do</h6>
            <p>Believe it or not, this section basically includes everything from the last section. Yes, I really do enjoy coding.<br><br></p>
            <p>But if you want me to prove I'm more than just a code-vomiting machine, look no further than my informal bar, <a href="www.theclevereggplant.com" target="_blank">The Clever Eggplant</a>, where I mix cocktails for StartX, Stanford's startup accelerator. I also cycle for my commute and recreationally. The day before I wrote this, a friend and I bicycled 26 miles through San Francisco on a whim. I also do Judo (brown belt, four years), and when that's not available, Brazilian Jiujitsu (white belt). My specialty is choking techniques. I also lift weights, with my proudest achievement being my 1x5 315 lb deadlift. I'm also a frequent patron of Red Rock Cafe in Mountain view and can often be found there with a hot drink and book (in both recreational and professional varieties) for company. </p>
