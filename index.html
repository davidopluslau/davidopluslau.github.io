<p>My name is David Lau. I'm a UC Berkeley graduate with a knack for software development, feet that prefer bicycle pedals to pavement, and a predilection for life satisfaction.</p>

        <h4>How I Got Here</h4>
            <p>It's been an unlikely journey. At the end of high school, I resolved not to join onto any of the stereotypical Asian careers of doctor/lawyer/engineer, and <bf>especially</bf> not a computer programmer. But it turns out, you can't escape destiny.</p>
            <p>At post-Judo practice dinner one night, another Judoka brought up a discovery of hers: a <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">blog from a dating website</a>. It had all sorts of insights: <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/"> women think men look atrocious but message them anyway. </a></a>If you want to determine your compatibility with someone, <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/">don't ask about God and sex, ask about horror films and traveling,</a> etc etc. I figured, this was all pretty cool, maybe I'll give an introductory course a shot. That initial interest in what I later discovered to be data science turned into one class... and then two... and then twelve. Along the way, I also discovered that I enjoyed just plain ol' software engineering. Building tools was fun. I did it first for <a href="http://www.vidcaster.com/">VidCaster</a> and then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>. There may be a day that I don't enjoy it anymore. But until then, I'll follow my heart.</p>
            
        <h5>Stuff I Can Do</h5>
        <p>My native language is Python, and I can slice a string or list with the best of them. I live and breathe Python. That said, much of my professional and serious academic work was done in Java, so I'm also fully fluent in that. I've used a Windows for personal computing my whole life, used a MacBook for a summer internship, and did all my academic work and most of my professional work in a Unix environment, so I have at least basic competency in all of them. In particular, I can out-grep almost all of my peers. I used to be a Vim snob; now I'm a Vim enthusiast (<a href="http://bytefluent.com/vivify/index.php?remote=raw.github.com%2Fdavidopluslau%2FLauVim%2Fmaster%2FLauIdleX.vim">my hand-crafted color scheme</a>, six hours of work and counting) who admits that Emacs has a lot of excellent strengths but still won't touch it. I've worked in the Django and Spring MVCs. And, I have a basic understanding of various front-end technologies like Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Though I'm no specialist in them, this page didn't (completely) build itself.</p>
        <p>I've got some other stuff I can do, but it's on my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59596352/Resume%20-%20David%20Lau.pdf">resume</a>. My email is davidopluslau@gmail.com (o-positive is my blood type). Feel free to ask more about my other skills, especially if you're the hiring sort :)</p>
        
        <h6>Stuff I Like to Do</h6>
            <p>Believe it or not, this section basically includes everything from the last section. Yes, I really do enjoy coding.</p>
            <p>But if you want me to prove I'm more than just a code-vomiting machine, bicycling's a good start. The day before I wrote this, a friend and I bicycled 26 miles through San Francisco on a whim. I bicycle basically everywhere. I also do Judo (brown belt, four years), and when that's not available, Brazilian Jiujitsu (white belt). My specialty is choking techniques. I also lift weights, with my proudest achievement being my 3x5 260 lb squat, well below parallel. I play video games as well. Sometimes I play a game for its artistic merit (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX48y24t9iU">Bastion</a>), sometimes I play a game for its innovation (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGsnm2nOnso">Antichamber</a>), and sometimes I play to enjoy time with friends (<a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/">LoL</a>). I can fill a kitchen with smoke in a three minute span to make the tastiest spicy chicken you've ever had, or I can spend twelve hours cooking beef so tender it'll melt on contact with your fork. I'll drink basically any beer but hand me a dark lager, porter, or stout and I can guarantee that the best you'll get in return is an empty bottle or glass.</p>
            
        <h7>Contacting me</h7>
            <p>I generally respond to emails in under an hour, so if you'd like to speak with me, I recommend you reach me at davidopluslau@berkeley.edu</p>
