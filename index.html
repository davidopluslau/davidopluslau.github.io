<p>My name is David Lau. I'm a UC Berkeley graduate with a knack for software development, a taste for nice beers, and a predilection for life satisfaction.</p>

        <h4>How I Got Here</h4>
            <p>It's been an unlikely journey. At the end of high school, I resolved not to join onto any of the stereotypical Asian careers of doctor/lawyer/engineer, and <bf>especially</bf> not a computer programmer. But it turns out, you can't escape destiny.</p>
            <p>At post-Judo practice dinner one night, another Judoka brought up a discovery of hers: a <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">blog from a dating website</a>. It had all sorts of insights: <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/"> women think men look atrocious but message them anyway. </a></a>If you want to determine your compatibility with someone, <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/">don't ask about God and sex, ask about horror films and traveling.</a> Etc etc. I figured, this was all pretty cool, maybe I'll give an introductory course a shot. That initial interest in what I later discovered to be data science turned into one class... and then two... and then eleven. Along the way, I also discovered that I enjoyed just plain ol' software engineering. Building tools was fun. I did it first for <a href="http://www.vidcaster.com/">VidCaster</a> and then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>. There may be a day that I don't enjoy it anymore. But until then, I'll follow my heart.</p>
