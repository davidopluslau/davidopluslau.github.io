<p>I'm David Lau. I'm a backend software engineer at LinkedIn. But my title isn't everything I am; for proof, ask me for a cocktail sometime.</p>

        <h4>How I Got Here</h4>
        <p>At post-Judo practice dinner one night, another Judoka brought up a discovery of hers: a <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/">blog from a dating website</a>. It had all sorts of insights: <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-looks-and-online-dating/"> women think men look atrocious but message them anyway. </a></a>If you want to determine your compatibility with someone, <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/">don't ask about God and sex, ask about horror films and traveling,</a> etc etc. I figured, this was all pretty cool, maybe I'll give an introductory course a shot. That initial interest in what I later discovered to be data science turned into one class... and then two... and then twelve. Along the way, I also discovered that I enjoyed just plain old software engineering. Building software was fun. I did it first in 2012 for <a href="http://www.vidlet.com/">VidCaster (now Vidlet)</a>, building them an internal analytics display, as well as real-time metrics for their customers. The following year, I joined onto <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>'s digital coupon team, where I built a tool to add and remove coupons from the popular deals page. In 2014, I began work with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/refresh-io">Refresh Inc.</a>, joining an incredible team to build the backend for a mobile app that builds digital dossiers on the people you meet. When we were acquired by <a href="https://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> in 2015, I moved over with my other teammates to work on a variety of projects. I rebuilt the Kafka jobs powering the work anniversary emails and jumped into building the Android portion of the new mobile app's calendar sync.</p>
        <p>At this point, I'd been in the Bay Area since birth, and I decided that it was time to see something more. In early 2017, I joined Manhattan-based Blue Apron to make a move across the country. Hired on to build out features for engagement and retention, I've come to find a new passion: performance. My manager has declared, only half joking, that I'm the entirety of our one-man performance team. As an avid user of the product (I get as many meals and wines as any one customer can request), I have my own stake in making sure the experience feels good!<p>

        <h4>Stuff I've Done</h4>
        <p>I jumped right out of graduation into a Refresh's overhaul of our mobile experience. I worked with the team to design and implement an architecture that would simultaneously improve the UI, maintain our blazing fast speed, and improve our flexibility and agility in adding new insights. The team and I did this all over again with our web overhaul, building an additional system that chose different payloads and formatting based on the intended client. And to feed consistent data to our apps, I helped populate a server with tens of millions of images and built an API layer on top of it to pull up the most appropriate image based on recency, media source, size, and other factors.<br><br></p>
        <p>I joined Refresh when it had fewer than ten engineers, and so I had a lot of responsibility beyond what a new hire would normally get, especially when it came to site reliability. I initiated about a quarter of our deployments to production and roll backs as necessary. I was the engineer in charge of maintaining our server fleet, which eventually grew to over twenty machines across three providers as I added, maintained, and decommissioned them. And lastly, I was the perennial secondary on-call for server outages, although thankfully, our team's philosophy of strong fault tolerance meant that my nights were never sleepless, just occasionally longer.<br><br></p>
        <p>My responsibilities changed a lot when I transitioned to LinkedIn. With my user base increased by over a hundred times, I put my Wild West-days of zero-testing behind me. Development cycles slowed, but in exchange, I reached more users. My technologies changed to reflect this: I wrote the first of what would be dozens of Hadoop jobs which would come to impact millions of users. I produced emails to help them claim certifications, projects, publications, and patents we determined, using heuristics, that they'd completed but never explicitly acknowlededged credit for. I rebuilt our legacy work anniversary update system—yes, <i>that</i> dreaded work anniversary system that so many members are so irritated by—to make it more maintanable, robust, and most importantly, relevant. And I had plenty of non-Hadoop work as well. I made notifications for job changes, birthdays and others smarter and with reduced load on upstream systems. And, at one point, I learned Android so that I could build calendar sync for the Android version of our mobile rebuild. If you've used it, then you've touched something I've built.</p>
            
        <h5>Stuff I Can Do</h5>
        <p>If a backend needs to be built, I can build it. The bulk of my experience so far is in Java and Python, but a project with an unfamiliar language won't be the first time that I've learned a new technology on the fly, and it won't be the last. I can write a dirty but effective bash script; my Unix is far from world-class, but I'm also the top contributor of macros, especially time-saving ones, to my team's utility page. I used to be a Vim snob; now I'm a Vim enthusiast (<a href="http://bytefluent.com/vivify/index.php?remote=raw.github.com%2Fdavidopluslau%2FLauVim%2Fmaster%2FLauIdleX.vim">my hand-crafted color scheme</a>, six hours of work and counting). I've worked in the Play, Django and Spring MVCs. And, I have a basic understanding of various front-end technologies like Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Though I'm no specialist in them, I built both this page as well as <a href="http://theclevereggplant.com" target="_blank">my bar's</a> page.<br><br></p>
        <p>I've got some other stuff I can do, but it's on my <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/59596352/Resume%20-%20David%20Lau.pdf">resume</a>. My email is davidopluslau@gmail.com (my blood type is O-positive). Feel free to ask more about my other skills, especially if you're the hiring sort :)</p>
        
        <h6>Stuff I Like to Do</h6>
            <p>Believe it or not, this section basically includes everything from the last section. Yes, I really do enjoy coding.<br><br></p>
            <p>But if you want me to prove I'm more than just a code-vomiting machine, look no further than my informal bar, <a href="http://theclevereggplant.com" target="_blank">The Clever Eggplant</a>, where I mix cocktails for StartX, Stanford's startup accelerator. As an intermediate powerlifter, I can deadlift 345lbs and squat 275. I also cycle for my commute and recreationally. The day before I wrote this, a friend and I bicycled 26 miles through San Francisco on a whim. I play ping pong with my team, which has developed a healthy respect for my backhand topspin. I'm also looking to resume Judo (brown belt, four years), and if that's not available, Brazilian Jiujitsu (white belt). My specialty is choking techniques. I'm also a frequent patron of Red Rock Cafe in Mountain view and can often be found there with a hot drink and book (in both recreational and professional varieties) for company.</p>
